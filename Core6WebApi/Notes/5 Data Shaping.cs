ExpandoObject

Data Shaping Resources
    -   Learning about the ExpandoObject
    -   Shaping collection & single resources
    -   Handling errors
    -   Data shaping allows the consumer of the API to choose the resource fields
        Shape on fields of the resource, not on fields  of lower-level layer objects
    -   We can create a reusable extension method to shape data
